                <h1>What Is Petanque</h1>
                <p>The game of Pétanque is a form of boules which originated from the south of France where the goal is to throw 
                    hollow metal balls as close as possible to a small wooden ball called a cochonnet or jack. The game is 
                    normally played on hard dirt or gravel, but can also be played on grass, sand or other surfaces. Pétanque can 
                    be played in public areas such as parks but many dedicated facilities have been built for this popular sport 
                    and these area called boulodromes.</p>
                <h1>How To Play</h1>
                <p>Pétanque is played by two teams, where each team consists of one, two, or three players. In the singles and 
                    doubles games each player has three boules; in triples each player has only two. First of all the home team 
                    will flip a coin with the opponents calling heads of tails to determine who will throw the cochonnet. The 
                    starting team draws a circle on the ground which is 35-50 centimetres in diameter but plastic circles are 
                    often provided and must be marked to show the location so it isn’t moved during the end being played, all 
                    players must throw their boules from within this circle, with both feet remaining on the ground. The first 
                    player throws the jack 6–10 meters away for the end to commence. The team that has thrown the cochonnet will 
                    play their first boule. A player from the opposing team then plays their boule and will continue to throw 
                    until they are closer to the cochonnet than the opponents boule or they use all their boule up. The teams 
                    switch depending who is closer to the cochonnet and once both teams have used all their boule a point is 
                    scored for each boule closer to the cochonnet that your opponents closest boule. For example: If you have 3 
                    boule closer to the cochonnet before your opponents closest boule, you will be awarded 3 points and throw the 
                    cochonnet on the next end. Place the circle around the cochonnet and as long as you are far enough away from 
                    the edge of the terrain and can throw the cochonnet the correct distance you may start the next end. This 
                    will continue until either the time limit is reached (if playing a timed match) or one of the teams reach 13 
                    points to win the game. </p>
                <h1>Throwing Technique</h1>
                <p>When standing in the circle with your feet within its boundaries you must either throw your boule underarm 
                    with an open palm or with palm down still underarm but as you throw extending your arm and having an upward 
                    flick of the wrist which will put a little bit of backspin on your boule giving you more control.</p>

                <h1>Club History</h1>
                <p>1979 the club was founded by Nick and Margaret Mitchell along with Claudine Guilmain at the Victoria Inn Public 
                House.</p>
                <p>1980 the club enters the NCPA League which was the clubs first official year and where the journey of Great 
                Ellinghams Current Best Petanque Club began. (Yes you can call yourself the best when you are the only one there 
                haha)</p>
                <p>1985 The club moves to the Eight Ringers Public House in Hingham and is renamed Hingham 51.</p>
                <p>1991 in a turn of events the club makes the move back to Deopham and is renamed Victoria 51.</p>
                <p>1995 Our Country Yokel Badge is introduced</p>
                <p>2001 and due to a rise in players the club expands to 2 teams. Gauloises won Division 3 in 2003 and Gitanes 
                won Division 3 in 2002.</p>
                <p>2005 With the sad loss of one of the clubs members the Club Competition is renamed The Bob Bruce Memorial 
                Pairs to which is still a fantastically popular and respected competition to play in of which he would be 
                proud.</p>
                <p>2005 Gitanes win Division 3 again</p>
                <p>2008 Gauloises won Division 3 again</p>
                <p>2009 the club moves to the Buck Public House in Morley St Botolph and the club is renamed 51 Petanque Club.</p>
                <p>2010 the Gitanes change their name to Buckaneers</p>
                <p>2016 the Buckaneers disband. In the same season the club moves to Scoulton Village Hall with just the Gauloises
                team while the new terrain is being built at Great Ellingham Recreation Center</p>
                <p>2017 51 Petanque Club starts a new era with the Gauloises team now named as The Millers and a new team called 
                Ellingham Oaks. During the first season for Ellingham Oaks they managed to gain promotion to Division 2 in a long 
                and hard fought season... closing in on the final few games Graham Beales club Captain, Leader and Legend lead the 
                squad to their promotion</p>
                <p>2020 to 2022 was a mixed few years due to Covid 19 but both teams in the summer league did very well with 
                Ellingham Oaks pushing at the top of the league and The Millers winning theirs</p>
