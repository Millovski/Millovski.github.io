                <h1>What Is Pétanque</h1>
                <p>The game of Pétanque is a form of boules which originated from the south of France, where the goal is to throw 
                    metal balls as close as possible to a small wooden ball called a cochonnet or jack. The game is 
                    normally played on hard dirt or gravel, but can also be played on grass, sand or other surfaces. Pétanque can 
                    be played in public areas such as parks but many dedicated facilities have been built.</p>
                <h1>How To Play</h1>
                <p>Pétanque is played by two teams, where each team consists of one, two, or three players. In the singles and 
                    doubles games each player has three boules; in triples each player has only two. First of all the home team 
                    will flip a coin with the opponents calling heads of tails to determine who will throw the cochonnet. The 
                    starting team draws a circle on the ground which is 35-50 centimetres in diameter, plastic circles are 
                    often provided and must be marked to show the location so it isn't moved during the end being played, all 
                    players must throw their boules from within this circle, with both feet remaining on the ground. The first 
                    player throws the jack 6-10 meters away for the end to commence. The team that has thrown the cochonnet will 
                    play their first boule. A player from the opposing team then plays their boule and will continue to throw 
                    until they are closer to the cochonnet than the opponents boule or they use all their boule up. The teams 
                    switch depending who is closer to the cochonnet and once both teams have used all their boule a point is 
                    scored for each boule closer to the cochonnet than your opponents closest boule. For example: If you have 3 
                    boule closer to the cochonnet before your opponents closest boule, you will be awarded 3 points and throw the 
                    cochonnet on the next end. Place the circle around the cochonnet and as long as you are far enough away from 
                    the edge of the terrain and can throw the cochonnet the correct distance you may start the next end. This 
                    will continue until either the time limit is reached (if playing a timed match) or one of the teams reach 13 
                    points to win the game.</p>
                <h1>Throwing Technique</h1>
                <p>When standing in the circle with your feet within its boundaries you must either throw your boule underarm 
                    with an open palm or with palm down still underarm but as you throw extending your arm and having an upward 
                    flick of the wrist which will put a little bit of backspin on your boule giving you more control.</p>
